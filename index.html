 <b>Albert Camus</b>(1913-1960)was a highly influential French-Algerian philosopher, novelist, essayist, and playweright , celebrated for his works that explore the human condition in the face of what he called the Absurd.<br>
​<b> Early Life and Influences:</b><br>
​Camus was born in <strong>Mondovi, French Algeria, in 1913</strong>. His father, a poor agricultural worker, was killed in World War I a year later. Camus was raised in a poverty-stricken, working-class neighborhood in Algiers by his partially deaf, illiterate mother and a strict grandmother. Despite his difficult start, he excelled academically, earning a scholarship to the University of Algiers where he studied philosophy. His early experiences with poverty, the vibrant life of <b>North Africa</b>, and a bout of <b>tuberculosis </b>(contracted at age 17) heavily influenced his work, giving him a perspective as an outsider in metropolitan France.<br>
​<b> Key Works and Philosophy:</b><br>
​Camus gained international acclaim during World War II with two major publications in 1942:
​<strong><em>L'Étranger (The Stranger or The Outsider)</em></strong>: His seminal novel, which depicts the alienation and indifference of a character named Meursault, embodying the <i>"nakedness of man faced with the absurd."</i>
​<i>Le Mythe de Sisyphe (The Myth of Sisyphus)</i>: A philosophical essay that formally introduces his concept of Absurdism—the fundamental conflict between humanity's innate desire for meaning and the universe's cold, silent indifference. Camus argues that the proper response is to acknowledge the <b>absurd, embrace freedom, and revolt</b> against it through passion and creation.<br>
​His subsequent works further explored these themes and a new concept:
​<strong>La Peste (The Plague) (1947)</strong>: A novel set in <b>Oran, Algeria,</b> where a doctor tirelessly fights a plague epidemic, representing a commitment to human solidarity and morality in the face of universal suffering.
​<i>L'Homme révolté (The Rebel) (1951)</i>: An essay that critiques <b>totalitarianism</b> and explores the concept of Revolt as a necessary human response to injustice, leading to a break with his former friend, existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre.<br>
<b> Later Life and Death:</b><br>
​Camus was an active journalist throughout his career, notably as the editor-in-chief of the Resistance newspaper, Combat, during the German Occupation of France. He was awarded <strong>the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1957 at the age of 44, making him the second-youngest recipient at the time.</strong>
​<strong>He died tragically three years later, in 1960, in a car accident in <i>France</i>.</strong> At the time of his death, he was working on an unfinished autobiographical novel, <em>Le Premier Homme (The First Man)</em>, which was published posthumously.
​Camus's legacy is that of a <strong>moralist and humanist</strong> who used his writing to urge people to find meaning and <b>solidarity</b> despite the <strong>ultimate meaninglessness of existence.<strong>
