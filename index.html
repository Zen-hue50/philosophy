 <b>Albert Camus</b>(1913-1960)was a highly influential French-Algerian philosopher, novelist, essayist, and playweright , celebrated for his works that explore the human condition in the face of what he called the Absurd.<br></p>
​<p style="font-size: 20px;"><b> Early Life and Influences:</b><br>
​Camus was born in <strong>Mondovi, French Algeria, in 1913</strong>. His father, a poor agricultural worker, was killed in World War I a year later. Camus was raised in a poverty-stricken, working-class neighborhood in Algiers by his partially deaf, illiterate mother and a strict grandmother. Despite his difficult start, he excelled academically, earning a scholarship to the University of Algiers where he studied philosophy. His early experiences with poverty, the vibrant life of <b>North Africa</b>, and a bout of <b>tuberculosis </b>(contracted at age 17) heavily influenced his work, giving him a perspective as an outsider in metropolitan France.<br></p>
​<p style="font-size: 20px;"><b> Key Works and Philosophy:</b><br>
​Camus gained international acclaim during World War II with two major publications in 1942:
​<strong><em>L'Étranger (The Stranger or The Outsider)</em></strong>: His seminal novel, which depicts the alienation and indifference of a character named Meursault, embodying the <i>"nakedness of man faced with the absurd."</i>
​<i>Le Mythe de Sisyphe (The Myth of Sisyphus)</i>: A philosophical essay that formally introduces his concept of Absurdism—the fundamental conflict between humanity's innate desire for meaning and the universe's cold, silent indifference. Camus argues that the proper response is to acknowledge the <b>absurd, embrace freedom, and revolt</b> against it through passion and creation.<br></p>
​<p style="font-size: 20px;">His subsequent works further explored these themes and a new concept:
​<strong>La Peste (The Plague) (1947)</strong>: A novel set in <b>Oran, Algeria,</b> where a doctor tirelessly fights a plague epidemic, representing a commitment to human solidarity and morality in the face of universal suffering.
​<i>L'Homme révolté (The Rebel) (1951)</i>: An essay that critiques <b>totalitarianism</b> and explores the concept of Revolt as a necessary human response to injustice, leading to a break with his former friend, existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre.<br></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;"><b> Later Life and Death:</b><br>
​Camus was an active journalist throughout his career, notably as the editor-in-chief of the Resistance newspaper, Combat, during the German Occupation of France. He was awarded <strong>the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1957 at the age of 44, making him the second-youngest recipient at the time.</strong>
​<strong>He died tragically three years later, in 1960, in a car accident in <i>France</i>.</strong> At the time of his death, he was working on an unfinished autobiographical novel, <em>Le Premier Homme (The First Man)</em>, which was published posthumously.
​Camus's legacy is that of a <strong>moralist and humanist</strong> who used his writing to urge people to find meaning and <b>solidarity</b> despite the <strong>ultimate meaninglessness of existence.<strong></p>

<td><b>The stranger:</b><br>Arguably Camus's most famous novel, it follows Meursault, an emotionally detached French Algerian who, after his mother's death, commits a senseless murder. The story is a raw examination of alienation, the absurdity of life, and the protagonist's refusal to conform to societal expectations and emotional norms, which ultimately becomes the real reason for his conviction.</td>

<td><b>A Happy Death: </b><br>A Happy Death was Camus' first novel and was clearly the precursor to his most famous work, The Stranger, published in 1942. The main character in A Happy Death is named "Patrice Mersault", similar to The Stranger's "Meursault"; both are French Algerian clerks who kill another man. A Happy Death is written in the third person, whereas The Stranger is written in the first person.</td>

<td><b>The Myth Of Sisyphus: </b><br>This influential philosophical essay lays out Camus's concept of Absurdism. It defines the absurd as the fundamental conflict between humanity's innate desire for meaning and the universe's silent, cold indifference. Using the Greek myth of Sisyphus—condemned to eternally roll a boulder up a hill—as a metaphor, Camus argues that happiness can be found by embracing the absurd and rebelling through conscious living, passion, and freedom.</td>

<td><b>The Plague:</b><br>Set in the quarantined city of Oran, Algeria, after a devastating plague outbreak, this novel functions as an allegory for the Nazi occupation and the broader human struggle against evil, death, and suffering. It focuses on ordinary citizens, particularly Dr. Rieux, who choose to fight the meaningless catastrophe with solidarity, collective action, and ethical resistance, showing the human capacity for resilience and moral responsibility.</td>

<td><b>The Fall:</b><br>Camus's last complete novel is a long, conversational monologue delivered by Jean-Baptiste Clamence, a former Parisian lawyer turned "judge-penitent" in Amsterdam. It is a piercing, satirical critique of hypocrisy, guilt, and the modern condition. The narrator confesses his moral failings and self-deception, forcing the reader to confront their own inherent duplicity and the universal human "fall" from innocence.</td>

<td><b>The Rebel:</b><br>A philosophical treatise that explores the history and nature of rebellion and revolution. Camus distinguishes between legitimate revolt, which affirms human dignity and sets moral limits, and destructive revolution, which descends into nihilism and tyranny. It is an extension of his exploration of the absurd, arguing that rebellion is the conscious, ethical response to injustice and the denial of human solidarity.</td>
